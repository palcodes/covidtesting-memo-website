    <h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
    <p>
      We propose that the <strong>Government of India</strong> deploy rapid,
      at-home paper-strip testing in major metropolitan areas such as Mumbai,
      Delhi, Pune, Bangalore, and Ahmedabad to test every individual in those
      areas at least once per week. Recent evidence from Slovakia, Liverpool,
      and Nova Scotia suggests that that this strategy is likely to help reduce
      the incidence of new infections by as much as 70% after just a few weeks
      of implementation, thus avoiding strict lockdowns, at a cost of just a few
      crores of rupees per day per city, which is orders of magnitude cheaper
      and less disruptive than the economic cost of further lockdowns.
    </p>
    <h2 id="background">Background</h2>
    <p>
      The <strong>COVID-19</strong> pandemic in India is currently surging at
      critical levels, in particular in the state of Maharashtra. In the past
      few weeks, the number of new cases reported in the state has averaged well
      over 50,000 every single day; the state now accounts for over a third, and
      sometimes close to half, of new infections across the country.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hospitals and health infrastructure in the state have been overwhelmed by
      the ongoing surge, with Intensive Care Units and COVID wards overflowing
      with new patients. The government of Maharashtra has recently instituted a
      strict lockdown in many areas across the state, and is contemplating even
      further statewide lockdown measures to curb the rapid increase in COVID
      caseload. The lockdowns -- coming while the state’s economy is still
      recovering from the economic shocks of 2020 -- are likely to have a
      disastrous economic impact: the state economy is predicted to lose Rs.
      40,000 crore every single month of strict lockdown, or more than 1300
      crores per day, an amount large enough to not only gravely harm many of
      Maharashtra’s key industries but also have a measurable impact on the
      economy of India as a whole<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number cit" for="sn-1"></label

    <p>
      Since the pandemic began, Maharashtra had COVID-tested slightly over 2
      crore samples in total, with Mumbai accounting for close to a quarter of
      that number

      >. However, the labs and testing centers that make this testing regimen
      possible have been unable to scale their capacity and processes fast
      enough to process many more tests; wait times have increased at both
      private and government labs, and the state government is considering a
      move to staff government labs 24/7 to account for the needed extra
      capacity. Further, even though asymptomatic carriers of COVID are the
      likely vectors of most of the current outbreak, insufficient capacity has
      led to deprioritizing testing on asymptomatic people -- hospitals are in
      fact still forbidden from walk-in rapid testing unless the person is
      already showing serious symptoms. Given these problems, it is likely that
      many asymptomatic carriers of COVID are still going undetected, thus
      creating new COVID clusters and spreading the virus further in the state.

      administration, so 10x as many tests can be administered for the same
      amount of money, which does indeed come out to 2.5 million given the 2.5
      lakh RT-PCR tests being administered daily in Mumbai. This would cost
      roughly 5 crores per day (accounting for overhead). Moreover, modelling
      from Romer and others suggests that even if these tests were to be less
      accurate, even in the range of 65%, mass administration would still
      massively curb spread

      millions of tests per month. If the state government is able to distribute
      enough tests per household in a given area that each individual tests
      themselves once per week, then the likelihood of someone being an
      unknowing carrier falls massively, and the spread of the disease will slow
      down dramatically.

    <h2 id="a-note">A Note on Vaccines</h2>
    <p>
      The distribution of <strong>COVID-19</strong> vaccines in phases
      throughout India offers a long-term solution to the
      <strong>COVID-19</strong> pandemic, and it is incontestable that rapidly
      scaling vaccination needs to be top of mind for the government and the
      pharmaceutical industry. Unfortunately, the surge -- and the economic
      impact of lockdowns -- has made it clear that the virus needs to be more
      effectively contained until vaccination reaches sufficient levels. While
      those of advanced age are being given priority for vaccination, the virus
      is spreading quickly through not only younger adults but also children,
      over 60,000 of whom have contracted the virus over the last month.
      Further, the supply of vaccines to Maharashtra has proven greatly
      insufficient compared to the rate of COVID spread, curbing the state’s
      vaccine drive; it may be months before a sufficient rate of vaccination is
      achieved in the state’s large urban centers, and over a year before the
      country as a whole is sufficiently immunized

        >India is unlikely to be vaccinated to the 70% level before the end of
        2021. Some conservative models estimate that India will not reach 70%
        vaccination until late 2022; see “More than 85 poor countries will not
        have widespread access to coronavirus vaccines before 2023,” The
        Economist Intelligence Unit, 27 Jan 2021:
        <a
          href="https://www.eiu.com/n/85-poor-countries-will-not-have-access-to-coronavirus-vaccines/"
          >https://www.eiu.com/n/85-poor-countries-will-not-have-access-to-coronavirus-vaccines/</a
        ></span
      >. In the meantime, the economic damage caused by continuing lockdowns
      would be catastrophic for the economy of the state.
    </p>
    <p>
      Health authorities in India, and globally, have also expressed concern
      about the rate of mutation of the COVID virus. A widespread variant in
      India currently classified as variant B.1.617, a twice-mutated strain of
      the virus, is likely to be particularly infective, and may have some
      resistance to the vaccines being deployed in India

        April 2021:

      >. Even if the vaccination drive accelerates in the near future,
      Maharashtra and India will likely have to contend with this variant, and
      others, for years to come.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is therefore clear that vaccinations alone cannot be the sole mass
      measure taken against COVID in the short and medium term. Vaccines and
      testing do not represent an either-or choice, but rather must form the two
      major components of a combined strategy for stamping out
      <strong>COVID-19</strong> in order to prevent devastation of lives and
      livelihoods.
    </p>
    <h2 id="proposal">The Proposal</h2>
    <p>
      We are happy to put together a team to run a large-scale trial of using
      at-home rapid testing in India to reduce
      <strong>COVID-19</strong> spread. I believe that we could reduce the daily
      incidence of new <strong>COVID-19</strong> cases in Mumbai by more than
      50% in just three weeks by testing 2 million people/day using rapid
      paper-strip tests distributed directly to peoples’ homes. We could conduct
      an initial test in a smaller area, perhaps covering 1-2 lakh people, and
      compare the incidence of <strong>COVID-19</strong> in that area to a
      similar area where the intervention has not occured (this could even be
      published as a study if desired). This is not likely to cost more than a
      few crore INR total. If this is satisfactory, the program could be rolled
      out citywide and even nationally very rapidly. While running this might
      cost on the order of a few crore INR daily across each large city, the
      economic losses avoided by businesses and the state (via tax revenue)
      would be orders of magnitude higher. Assuming the projection that the
      state of Maharashtra will lose 40,000 crores every month of lockdown is
      correct, and assuming testing the entire state costs as much as 20 crores
      a day, the total cost of testing per month will come out to 600 crores; if
      a lockdown can avoided with such testing, the regimen would pay for itself
      close to 70 times over.
