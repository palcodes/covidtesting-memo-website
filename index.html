    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
      We propose that the Government of India deploy rapid, at-home paper-strip
      testing in major metropolitan areas such as Mumbai, Delhi, Pune,
      Bangalore, and Ahmedabad to test every individual in those areas at least
      once per week. Recent evidence from Slovakia, Liverpool, and Nova Scotia
      suggests that that this strategy is likely to help reduce the incidence of
      new infections by as much as 70% after just a few weeks of implementation,
      thus avoiding strict lockdowns, at a cost of just a few crores of rupees
      per day per city, which is orders of magnitude cheaper and less disruptive
      than the economic cost of further lockdowns.
    </p>
    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>
      The COVID-19 pandemic in India is currently surging at critical levels, in
      particular in the state of Maharashtra. In the past few weeks, the number
      of new cases reported in the state has averaged well over 50,000 every
      single day; the state now accounts for over a third, and sometimes close
      to half, of new infections across the country.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hospitals and health infrastructure in the state have been overwhelmed by
      the ongoing surge, with Intensive Care Units and COVID wards overflowing
      with new patients. The government of Maharashtra has recently instituted a
      strict lockdown in many areas across the state, and is contemplating even
      further statewide lockdown measures to curb the rapid increase in COVID
      caseload. The lockdowns -- coming while the state’s economy is still
      recovering from the economic shocks of 2020 -- are likely to have a
      disastrous economic impact: the state economy is predicted to lose Rs.
      40,000 crore every single month of strict lockdown, or more than 1300
      crores per day, an amount large enough to not only gravely harm many of
      Maharashtra’s key industries but also have a measurable impact on the
      economy of India as a <span class="cit" id="1">whole<sup>1</sup></span
      >, not to mention the human toll of the tens of millions of subsistence
      workers who might starve or be unable to feed their families as a result.
    </p>
    <h2>COVID Testing in Maharashtra</h2>
    <p>
      Since the pandemic began, Maharashtra had COVID-tested slightly over 2
      crore samples in total, with Mumbai accounting for close to a quarter of
      that <span class="cit" id="2">number <sup>2</sup></span> . The state has
      ramped up its testing count in the last week or two, and is currently
      testing some 2 lakh samples per day across the state; it has also lowered
      the maximum cost of a COVID test to Rs. 500 or Rs. 800
      <span class="cit" id="3"> (for a home visit) <sup> 3 </sup></span>.
      However, the labs and testing centers that make this testing regimen
      possible have been unable to scale their capacity and processes fast
      enough to process many more tests; wait times have increased at both
      private and government labs, and the state government is considering a
      move to staff government labs 24/7 to account for the needed extra
      capacity. Further, even though asymptomatic carriers of COVID are the
      likely vectors of most of the current outbreak, insufficient capacity has
      led to deprioritizing testing on asymptomatic people -- hospitals are in
      fact still forbidden from walk-in rapid testing unless the person is
      already showing serious symptoms. Given these problems, it is likely that
      many asymptomatic carriers of COVID are still going undetected, thus
      creating new COVID clusters and spreading the virus further in the state.
    </p>
    <h2>Universal Testing using Rapid At-Home Tests</h2>
    <p>
      Since April of 2020, a number of different epidemiologists and social
      scientists, including an author of this
      <span class="cit" id="4">note<sup>4</sup></span> , the Nobel-prize winning
      economist <span class="cit" id="5">Paul Romer<sup>5</sup></span
      >, and the Harvard public health professor
      <span class="cit" id="6">Michael Mina <sup>6</sup></span> , have suggested
      a strategy of universal testing using rapid tests -- testing everyone in
      the population at least once a week or more. A number of independently
      constructed models all point to the same conclusion -- testing everyone
      once a week would reduce the incidence of COVID-19 by more than
      <span class="cit" id="7">50% <sup>7</sup> </span> . In Mumbai, this would
      mean testing 2.5 million people per day.
    </p>
    <p>
      While there was initially a lot of uncertainty about the use of rapid
      lateral flow-based paper-strip tests, which resulted in ICMR capping the
      use of rapid tests at less than 30% of overall
      <span class="cit" id="8"> capacity <sup>8</sup></span> , it is now clear
      that they function nearly as well as RT-PCR tests in detecting infectious
      individuals who are actively shedding the
      <span class="cit" id="9"> virus <sup>9</sup> </span> , with sensitivity
      and specificity both exceeding 85% for well-manufactured versions, while
      being at least an order of magnitude cheaper to administer -- at scale,
      rapid paper tests could cost under
      <span class="cit" id="10">20 INR <sup>10</sup></span> per administration,
      while RT-PCR tests cost at least Rs. 200 per administration, so 10x as
      many tests can be administered for the same amount of money, which does
      indeed come out to 2.5 million given the 2.5 lakh RT-PCR tests being
      administered daily in Mumbai. This would cost roughly 5 crores per day
      (accounting for overhead). Moreover, modelling from Romer and others
      suggests that even if these tests were to be less accurate, even in the
      range of 65%, mass administration would still massively curb
      <span class="cit" id="11"> spread <sup> 11</sup> </span>. Understanding
      this requires looking at the tests in aggregate as a public health measure
      to curb community transmission, as opposed to a medical intervention
      intended to provide a maximally accurate diagnosis to each individual.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are at least two biotech companies in Maharashtra that can
      manufacture paper-strip tests -- one, MyLab, has even been funded to do
      this by the
      <span class="cit" id="12">central government <sup>12</sup></span> .
      Collectively, they have production capacity that can scale to 100s of
      millions of tests per month. If the state government is able to distribute
      enough tests per household in a given area that each individual tests
      themselves once per week, then the likelihood of someone being an
      unknowing carrier falls massively, and the spread of the disease will slow
      down dramatically.
    </p>
    <p>
      The evidence for the efficacy of mass testing in this manner is now quite
      substantial. On a small scale, data from American college campuses and the
      NBA bubble has shown the effectiveness of regular, frequent testing to
      avoid <span class="cit" id="13">COVID spread <sup>13</sup></span
      >. On a larger scale, entire regions and even small countries have halted
      the spread through mass rapid testing. Most notably, the nation of
      Slovakia similarly tested its entire population in space of a few weeks
      using rapid tests last year, and by doing so reduced the national spread
      of COVID by some 70% in just a few weeks of testing, as reported in a
      recent paper in <span class="cit" id="14"> Science<sup>14 </sup> </span> .
      The Canadian province of Nova Scotia has used pop-up rapid tests like the
      ones proposed here to avoid the larger caseload of other regions in the
      <span class="cit" id="15">country <sup>15</sup></span
      >. The UK government has announced a policy of making twice-weekly at-home
      rapid tests available for free to all individuals in England on the basis
      of a successful trial in the city of
      <span class="cit" id="16">Liverpool <sup>16</sup> </span> . These results
      overcame significant skepticism of the utility of mass rapid testing in
      the United States, as a result of which the National Institutes of Health
      and the Centers for Disease Control in the US have just initiated pilot
      programs to deploy large-scale at-home testing to curb
      <span class="cit" id="17">community spread <sup>17</sup></span> as have
      major companies like Citibank, in cooperation with
      <span class="cit" id="18"> Harvard University <sup> 18</sup></span>
    </p>
    <h2>A Note on Vaccines</h2>
    <p>
      The distribution of COVID-19 vaccines in phases throughout India offers a
      long-term solution to the COVID-19 pandemic, and it is incontestable that
      rapidly scaling vaccination needs to be top of mind for the government and
      the pharmaceutical industry. Unfortunately, the surge -- and the economic
      impact of lockdowns -- has made it clear that the virus needs to be more
      effectively contained until vaccination reaches sufficient levels. While
      those of advanced age are being given priority for vaccination, the virus
      is spreading quickly through not only younger adults but also children,
      over 60,000 of whom have contracted the virus over the last month.
      Further, the supply of vaccines to Maharashtra has proven greatly
      insufficient compared to the rate of COVID spread, curbing the state’s
      vaccine drive; it may be months before a sufficient rate of vaccination is
      achieved in the state’s large urban centers, and over a year before the
      country as a whole is sufficiently
      <span class="cit" id="19"> immunized <sup>19</sup> </span>. In the
      meantime, the economic damage caused by continuing lockdowns would be
      catastrophic for the economy of the state.
    </p>
    <p>
      Health authorities in India, and globally, have also expressed concern
      about the rate of mutation of the COVID virus. A widespread variant in
      India currently classified as variant B.1.617, a twice-mutated strain of
      the virus, is likely to be particularly infective, and may have some
      resistance to the vaccines being deployed in
      <span class="cit" id="20">India <sup>20</sup> </span> . Even if the
      vaccination drive accelerates in the near future, Maharashtra and India
      will likely have to contend with this variant, and others, for years to
      come.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is therefore clear that vaccinations alone cannot be the sole mass
      measure taken against COVID in the short and medium term. Vaccines and
      testing do not represent an either-or choice, but rather must form the two
      major components of a combined strategy for stamping out COVID-19 in order
      to prevent devastation of lives and livelihoods.
    </p>
    <h2>The Proposal</h2>
    <p>
      We are happy to put together a team to run a large-scale trial of using
      at-home rapid testing in India to reduce COVID-19 spread. I believe that
      we could reduce the daily incidence of new COVID-19 cases in Mumbai by
      more than 50% in just three weeks by testing 2 million people/day using
      rapid paper-strip tests distributed directly to peoples’ homes. We could
      conduct an initial test in a smaller area, perhaps covering 1-2 lakh
      people, and compare the incidence of COVID-19 in that area to a similar
      area where the intervention has not occured (this could even be published
      as a study if desired). This is not likely to cost more than a few crore
      INR total. If this is satisfactory, the program could be rolled out
      citywide and even nationally very rapidly. While running this might cost
      on the order of a few crore INR daily across each large city, the economic
      losses avoided by businesses and the state (via tax revenue) would be
      orders of magnitude higher. Assuming the projection that the state of
      Maharashtra will lose 40,000 crores every month of lockdown is correct,
      and assuming testing the entire state costs as much as 20 crores a day,
      the total cost of testing per month will come out to 600 crores; if a
      lockdown can avoided with such testing, the regimen would pay for itself
      close to 70 times over.
